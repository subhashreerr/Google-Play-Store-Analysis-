# Google-Play-Store-Analysis-
As a part of my college Visualization Project, I started working with Google Play Store data. 

  -The overview of the project can be understood from the insights given in the power point.
  
  -The .py file contains the pre-processing that has been done. 
  
  -The Tableau file gives the detailed visualization work that has been showcased in the power point presentation.
  
  -The raw data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps
